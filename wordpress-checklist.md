# The Wordpress Checklist

This list assumes you’re comfortable with your development tools and have an environment to install Wordpress in. Likewise, it won’t really go into general web development best practices, just things specific to Wordpress.

- Download the latest version of Wordpress. May as well kick things off with (hopefully) the most secure and stable version available.
- Install Wordpress in the location of your choice. [Official installation guide here.](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress)
- Think about something reasonably secure when choosing an admin username and password. For example, _admin_ is probably a bad username.
- Check your Settings and make sure URLs, timezones, etc are all configured as required.
- Delete the sample content. You don’t need it.
- Delete the _Hello Dolly_ plugin. You don’t need it.
- Configure the permalinks settings. This is mainly preference, but have a think about SEO and whatnot.
- Double-check the Uploads Path setting. This probably doesn’t need to change, but might help you find files later.
- Install some kind of security plugin. There are quite a few out there, see _Useful Plugins_ in the readme.
- If you plan on having comments switched on, probably better get _Akismet_ set up.
- Install your theme. If you want to build a bespoke design, [_HTML5 Blank_](http://html5blank.com/) works well for me.

From here, there are a lot of options. Inevitably, this basic Wordpress installation will need to be extended with some plugins. Have a read of the _Useful Plugins_ in the readme for some ideas.
